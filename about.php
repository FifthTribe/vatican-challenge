              <h1>About the Challenge</h1>
              <p>
                <span>The Laudato Si’ Startup Challenge</span>, inspired by Pope Francis, is a global initiative that supports early to mid-stage startups in developing breakthrough enterprise solutions to the world’s most urgent challenges. The challenge, a Right Now! initiative, is set by His Holiness Pope Francis and The Pontifical Council for Justice &amp; Peace, and the competition is open to applicants from all continents and faiths.<br/>

                <span>The Laudato Si’ Startup Challenge</span> will forge a business model to demonstrate that business solutions can realign our relationships to accord with the planet, our only common home. Wherever there is a vulnerable ecosystem, there are vulnerable people; any service to mitigate the crisis involving our common home is also a service to the world’s most disadvantaged people. The inaugural challenge will be launched on May 5th, 2017, and aims to become a multi-year initiative to stimulate and develop innovative businesses through a rigorous and tested process.
              </p>
              <h5>MISSION</h5>
              <p> <span>The Laudato Si’ Startup Challenge</span> will unite humanity in common purpose and productive conversation, much like His Holiness Pope Francis’s “Revolution of Tenderness.” It will be a beacon of new business, inspiring a new generation of entrepreneurs to build for-profit, for-purpose companies that address humanity’s biggest challenges in ways that are beneficial to all.
