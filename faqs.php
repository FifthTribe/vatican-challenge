                <h4 class="chapter">Logistics</h4>
                <h5>Q1. When will I be notified if I am moving forward in the process after applying?</h5>
                <p> You will be notified by the end of the first week in June with our decision.
                </p><br>

                <h5>Q2. Am I responsible for housing if my company is chosen for the Accelerator in Rome?</h5>
                <p>We offer airfare and housing subsidy if you are chosen for the Rome accelerator. More information will be provided in June.
                </p><br>

                <h5>Q3. Will I need a VISA?</h5>
                <p>Whether you will need a VISA depends on your country of citizenship. You can visit VISAHQ.com to help determine your travel status. Make sure your passport is current with extra pages. If chosen to participate in The Laudato Si’ Challenge we are happy to provide a letter of endorsement that can be used as part of your application process for a Visa. To receive a letter of endorsement, please contact <a href="mailto:info@laudatosichallenge.org">info@laudatosichallenge.org</a>.
                </p><br><br>

                <h4 class="chapter">Company Fit</h4>
                <h5>Q4. Is there specific criteria for determining finalist?</h5>
                <p>Key criteria may include: uniqueness in approaching the problem of climate change and human migration; the team’s proven ability to execute, adapt and grow; impactfulness of the solution (i.e., How many people can you positively affect?); investability and scalability; ability to demonstrate a working product or fully functional prototype.
                </p><br>

                <h5>Q5. What if I already have investors?</h5>
                <p>As long as you have not raised more than <span>$2M USD</span>, you are eligible for the program.
                </p><br>

                <h5>Q6. In what stage does my company need to be?</h5>
                <p>To apply, your company needs to have a functioning prototype/service and it should show measurable traction.
                </p><br><br>

                <h4 class="chapter">Legal</h4>
                <h5>Q7. Do I need an established legal entity to apply?</h5>
                <p> <span>Yes.</span> Because all investments made by The Laudato Si’ Challenge represent an equity stake in your company, you will need to have a legal entity surrounding your company.
                </p><br>

                <h5>Q8. What does it cost to apply? </h5>
                <p>There is no fee to apply to the program.
                </p><br><br>

                <h4 class="chapter">ACCELERATOR DETAILS</h4>

                <h5>Q9. How much access will I have to my assigned Mentor?</h5>
                <p>How much time you spend together is up to you and your Mentor, but they have committed to one meeting per week for the first month, followed by monthly meetings until the end of the year. A world-class, trusted adviser, he or she will also act as your main advocate with “The Vatican 12” selection committee. Your mentor will communicate with the selection committee about your growth, adaptability, and your team’s ability to reach milestones.
                </p><br>

                <h5>Q10. What does Demo Day look like?</h5>
                <p>Because the Accelerator program focuses on growth metrics, our Demo Day will be more of a celebration rather than a stressful event for the startups.
